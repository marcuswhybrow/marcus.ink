**Enjolras:**
Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men?
It is the music of the people who will not be slaves again!
When the beating of your heart, echoes the beating of the drums,
there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes!

**Combeferre:**
Will you join in our crusade? who will be strong and stand with me?
Beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see?

**Courfeyrac:**
Then join in the fight that will give you the right to be free!

<p class="chorus">
  Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men?
  It is the music of the people who will not be slaves again!
  When the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums,
  there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes!
</p>

**Feuilly:**
Will you give all you can give, so that our banner may advance?
Some will fall and some will live, will you stand up and take your chance?
The blood of the martyrs will water the meadows of France!

<p class="chorus">
  Do you hear the people sing? Singing the song of angry men?
  It is the music of the people who will not be slaves again!
  When the beating of your heart, echoes the beating of the drums,
  there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.
