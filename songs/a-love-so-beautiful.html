<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    The summer sun looked down on our love long ago.
    But in my heart I feel the same old afterglow.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    A love so beautiful, in every way.
    A love so beautiful, we let it slip away.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We were too young to understand, to ever know,
    that lovers drift apart and that's the way love goes.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    A love so beautiful, a love so sweet.
    A love so beautiful, a love for you and me.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">And when I think of you, I fall in love again</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    A love so beautiful, in every way.
    A love so beautiful, we let it slip away.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    A love so beautiful, in every way.
    A love so beautiful, we let it slip away.
  </p>
