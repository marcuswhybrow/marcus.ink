Love of my life, you've hurt me. You've broken my heart and now you leave me.

<p class="chorus">
  Love of my life, can't you see? Bring it back, bring it back.
  Don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.
</p>

Love of my life, don't leave me. You've taken my love. You now desert me.

<p class="chorus">
  Love of my life, can't you see? Bring it back, bring it back.
  Don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.
</p>

You will remember when this is blown over and everything's all by the way.
When I grow older I will be there at your side to remind you how I still love you.
I still love you.

<p class="mark">Guitar Solo</p>

Back, hurry back. Please, bring it back home to me because you don't know what it means to me.

Love of my life. Love of my life.
