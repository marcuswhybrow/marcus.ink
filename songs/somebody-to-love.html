  <p>Can anybody find me somebody to love?</p>
  
  <p>
    Each morning I get up I die a little, can barely stand on my feet.
    Take a look in the mirror and cry "Lord, what you're doing to me".
  </p>
  
  <p>I have spent all my years in believing you, but I just can't get no relief, Lord!</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">Somebody (somebody), somebody (somebody), can anybody find me somebody to love?</p>
  
  <p>
    I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life. I work 'til I ache my bones.
    At the end (at the end of the day) I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I go down (down) on my knees (knees) and I start to pray (praise the Lord).
    'Til the tears run down from my eyes Lord.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">Somebody (somebody), somebody (please), can anybody find me somebody to love?</p>
  
  <p>
    (He works hard) everyday (everyday). I try, and I try, and I try.
    But everybody wants to put me down: they say I'm goin' crazy.
    They say I got a lot of water in my brain, I got no common sense.
    I got nobody left to believe in (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah).
  </p>

  <p class="chorus">Somebody (somebody), somebody (somebody), can anybody find me somebody to love?</p>
  
  <p>Can anybody find me someone to love?</p>
  
  <p>
    Got no feel, I got no rhythm. I just keep losing my beat.
    I'm OK, I'm alright. I ain't gonna face no defeat.
    I just gotta get out of this prison cell. One day I'm gonna be free, Lord!
