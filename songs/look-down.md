<p class="chorus">
  Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aah.
  Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aah.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Look down, look down, don't look 'em in the eye.
  Look down, look down, you're here until you die.
</p>

**Prisoner 1:** The sun, is strong, it's hot as hell below!

<p class="chorus">Look down, look down, there's twenty years to go.</p>

**Prisoner 2:** I've done, no wrong, sweet Jesus hear my prayer.

<p class="chorus">Look down, look down, sweet Jesus doesn't care.</p>

**Prisoner 3:** I know, she'll wait, I know that she'll be true.

<p class="chorus">Look down, look down, they've all forgotten you.</p>

**Prisoner 4:** _When I get free you won't see me. Here for dust._

<p class="chorus">
  Look down, look down, don't look 'em in the eye.
</p>

**Prisoner 5:** How long, oh lord, before you let me die?

<p class="chorus">
  Look down, look down, you'll always be a slave.
  Look down, look down, you're standing in your grave.
</p>

**Javert:** Now bring me prisoner 24601. Your time is up and your parole's begun.
You know what that means?

**Valjean:** Yes, it means I'm free.

**J:** No! It means you get your yellow ticket-of-leave.
You are a thief.

**Valjean:** I stole a loaf of bread.

**J:** You robbed a house!

**Valjean:** I broke a window pane.

**. . .** My sister's child was close to death, and we were starving-

**J:** -you will starve again. Unless you learn the meaning of the law.

**Valjean:** I know the meaning of those nineteen years. A slave of the law.

**J:** Five years for what you did. The rest because you tried to run. Yes, 24601.

**Valjean:** My name is Jean Valjean!

**J:** And I'm Javert.
Do not forget my name.
Do not forget me, 24601.

<p class="chorus">
  Look down, look down, you'll always be a slave.
  Look down, look down, you're standing in your grave.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aah.
  Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aah.
