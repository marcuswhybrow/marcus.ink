**Thenardier:** _Welcome, monsieur, sit yourself down, and meet the best innkeeper in town.
As for the rest, all of 'em crooks, rooking their guests and cooking the books.
Seldom do you see, honest men like me.
A gent of good intent, who's content to be:_

**. . .** Master of the house, doling out the charm, ready with a handshake and an open palm.
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir, customers appreciate a bon-viveur.
Glad to do a friend a favor, doesn't cost me to be nice.
But nothing gets you nothing, everything has got a little price!

**. . .** Master of the house, keeper of the zoo, ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two.
Watering the wine, making up the weight, pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight.
Everybody loves a landlord, everybody's bosom friend.
I do whatever pleases. Jesus! won't I bleed 'em in the end!

<p class="chorus">
  Master of the house, quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by.
  Servant to the poor, butler to the great, comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
  Everybody's boon companion, everybody's chaperone.
</p>

**Thenardier:** But lock up your valises. Jesus! won't I skin you to the bone!

**. . .** Enter monsieur, lay down your load, unlace your boots, rest from the road.
This weighs a ton, travel's a curse, but here we strive to lighten your purse.
Here the goose is cooked, here the fat is fried.
And nothing's overlooked, till I'm satisfied.

**. . .** Food beyond compare, food beyond belief, mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef.
Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat, filling up the sausages with this and that.
Residents are more than welcome, bridal suite is occupied.
Reasonable charges plus some little extras on the side.

**. . .** Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice, two percent for looking in the mirror twice.
Here a little slice, there a little cut, three percent for sleeping with the window shut.
When it comes to fixing prices, there are a lot of tricks he knows.
How it all increases, all those bits and pieces, Jesus! it's amazing how it grows!

<p class="chorus">
  Master of the house, quick to catch your eye, never wants a passerby to pass him by.
  Servant to the poor, butler to the great, comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate.
  Everybody's boon companion, gives 'em everything he's got.
  Dirty bunch of geezers, Jesus! what a sorry little lot.
</p>

**Madame Thenardier:** _I used to dream that I would meet a prince.
  But god almighty, have you seen what's happened since?_

**. . .** Master of the house? isn't worth me spit! 'Comforter, philosopher,' and lifelong shit.
Cunning little brain, regular voltaire, thinks he's quite a lover, but there's not much there.
What a cruel trick of nature, landed me with such a louse.
God knows how I've lasted, living with this bastard in the house.

<p class="chorus">Master of the house-</p>

**Madame Thenardier:** -Master and a half!

<p class="chorus">Comforter, philosopher-</p>

**Madame Thenardier:** -don't make me laugh!

<p class="chorus">Servant to the poor, butler to the great-</p>

**Madame Thenardier:** -hypocrite and toady and inebriate!

<p class="chorus">Everybody bless the landlord! Everybody bless his spouse!</p>

**Thenardier:** Everybody raise a glass!

<p class="chorus">Hey!</p>

**Madame Thenardier:** Raise it up the master's arse!

<p class="chorus">Whoo!</p>

<p class="chorus">Everybody raise a glass to the master of the house!</p>
