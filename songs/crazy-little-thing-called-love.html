    This thing called love I just can't handle it.
    This thing called love I must get round to it.
    I ain't ready.
    Crazy little thing called love.

  <p>
    This thing (this thing) called love (called love) it cries (like a baby) in a cradle all night.
    It swings (ooh, ooh), it jives (ooh, ooh), it shakes all over like a jelly fish.
    I kinda like it. Crazy little thing called love.
  </p>

  <p class="bridge">
    There goes my baby
    She knows how to rock-n-roll
    She drives me crazy
    She gives me hot and cold fever
    She leaves me in a cool, cool sweat
  </p>

  <p>
    I gotta be cool, relax, get hip, get on my tracks.
    Take a back seat, hitch-hike, and take a long ride on my motorbike;
    Until I'm ready. Crazy little thing called love.

  <p>
    I gotta be cool, relax, get hip, and get on my tracks.
    Take a back seat, hitch-hike, and take a long ride on my motorbike.
    Until I'm ready (Ready Freddie). Crazy little thing called love.
