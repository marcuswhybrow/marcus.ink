# Act I, 
---

At the end of the day you're another day older,
and that's all you can say for the life of the poor.
It's a struggle, it's a war, and there's nothing that anyone's giving.
One more day standing about, what is it for?

One day less to be living.

At the end of the day you're another day colder.
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill.
And the righteous hurry past, they don't hear the little ones crying,
And the plague is coming on fast . Ready to kill.

One day nearer to dying.

At the end of the day there's another day dawning,
and the sun in the morning is waiting to rise.
Like the waves crash on the sand, like a storm that'll break any second.
There's a hunger in the land, there's a reckoning still to be reckoned,
and there's gonna be hell to pay.

At the end of the day!

At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing.
Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread.

There are children back at home,
and the children have got to be fed,
and you're lucky to be in a job,
and in a bed.

And we're counting our blessings.

Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way.
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands.

And the boss, he never knows;
that the Foreman is always on heat.
If Fantine doesn't look out,
watch how she goes:

She'll be out on the street!

At the end of the day it's another day over,
with enough in your pocket to last for a week.
Pay the landlord, pay the shop.
Keep on working as long as you're able.
Keep on working 'til you drop,
or it's back to the crumbs off the table,
well, you've got to pay your way.

At the end of the day.

And what have we here, little innocent sister?
Come on, Fantine, let's have all the news.
"Dear Fantine, you must send us more money,
your child needs a doctor, there's no time to lose."

**Fantine:**
Give that letter to me it is none of your bus'ness,
with a husband at home and a bit on the side.
Is there anyone here who can swear before God
she has nothing to fear, she has nothing to hide?

**Valjean:**
What is this shouting all about, will someone tear these two apart, this is a factory, not a circus.
Now come on, ladies, settle down. I run a business of repute, I am the Mayor of this town.

I look to you to sort this out, and be as patient as you can.

**Foreman:**
Now, someone say how this began.

At the end of the day she's the one who began it.
There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town.
There's a man she has to pay. You can guess how she picks up the extra,
you can bet she's earning her keep sleeping around.

And the boss wouldn't like it.

**Fantine:**
Yes, it's true there's a child and the child is my daughter,
and her father abandoned us, leaving us flat.
Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife,
and I pay for the child, what's the matter with that.

At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble,
and there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one.
While we're earning our daily bread,
she's the one with her hands in the butter,
you must send the slut away,
or we're gonna end in the gutter.

It's us who'll have to pay.

At the end of the day.

**Foreman:**
I might have known the bitch could bite, I might have known the cat had claws. I might have guessed your little secret.
Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine,
who keeps herself so pure and clean, you'd be the cause I had no doubt, of any trouble hereabout.
You play a virgin in the light but need no urgin' in the night!

She's been laughing at you while she's having her men.
She'll be nothing but trouble again and again.
You must sack her today. Sack the girl today!

**Foreman:**
Right, my girl. On your way!
