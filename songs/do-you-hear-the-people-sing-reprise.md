Do you hear the people sing?
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of a people
who are climbing to the light.

For the wretched of the earth
there is a flame that never dies.
Even the darkest night will end
and the sun will rise.

_They will live again in freedom in the garden of the Lord.
They will walk behind the ploughshare.
They will put away the sword.
The chain will be broken and all men will have their reward!!_


<p class="chorus">
  Will you join in our crusade?
  Who will be strong and stand with me?
  Somewhere beyond the barricade
  is there a world you long to see?
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Do you hear the people sing?
  Say, do you hear the distant drums?
  It is the future that they bring
  when tomorrow comes!
</p>
