Every time I look into your lovely eyes,
I see a love that money just can't buy.

One look from you, I drift away.
I pray that you are here to stay.

<p class="chorus">
  Anything you want, you got it.
  Anything you need, you got it.
  Anything at all, you got it.
  Baby!
</p>

Every time I hold you I begin to understand,
everything about you tells me I'm your man.

I live my life to be with you.
No one can do the things you do.

<p class="chorus">
  Anything you want, you got it.
  Anything you need, you got it.
  Anything at all, you got it.
  Baby!
</p>

<p class="bridge">
  Anything you want (you got it),
  Anything you need (you got it),
  Anything at all!
</p>

<p class="mark">Interlude</p>

I'm glad to give my love to you.
I know you feel the way I do.

<p class="chorus">
  Anything you want, you got it.
  Anything you need, you got it.
  Anything at all, you got it.
  Baby!
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Anything you want, you got it.
  Anything you need, you got it.
  Anything at all, you got it.
  Baby!
</p>

Anything at all (you got it).
Baby, you got it!
