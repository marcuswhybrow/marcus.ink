The summer sun looked down on our love long ago.
But in my heart I feel the same old afterglow.

<p class="chorus">
  A love so beautiful, in every way.
  A love so beautiful, we let it slip away.
</p>

We were too young to understand, to ever know,
that lovers drift apart and that's the way love goes.

<p class="chorus">
  A love so beautiful, a love so sweet.
  A love so beautiful, a love for you and me.
</p>

<p class="bridge">And when I think of you, I fall in love again</p>

<p class="chorus">
  A love so beautiful, in every way.
  A love so beautiful, we let it slip away.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  A love so beautiful, in every way.
  A love so beautiful, we let it slip away.
</p>
