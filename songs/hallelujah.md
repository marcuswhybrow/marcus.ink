I heard there was a secret chord,
that David played and it pleased the Lord,
but you don't really care for music, do you?

Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth,
the minor fall and the major lift,
the baffled king composing Hallelujah.

<p class="chorus">
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah.
</p>

Your faith was strong but you needed proof,
you saw her bathing on the roof,
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya.

She tied you to her kitchen chair,
she broke your throne and she cut your hair,
and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.

<p class="chorus">
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah.
</p>

Baby I've been here before,
i've seen this room, i've walked this floor,
I used to live alone before I knew ya.

And I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
and love is not a victory march,
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.

<p class="chorus">
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah.
</p>

Well there was a time when you let me know,
what's really going on below,
but now you never show that to me do ya.

But remember when I moved in you,
and the holy dove was moving too,
and every breath we drew was Hallelujah.

<p class="chorus">
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah.
</p>

Maybe there's a God above,
but all I've ever learned from love,
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya.

And it's not a cry that you hear at night,
it's not somebody who's seen the light,
it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.

<p class="chorus">
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah
  Hallelujah.
</p>
