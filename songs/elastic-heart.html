<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    And another one bites the dust.
    Oh why can I not conquer love?
    And I might have thought that we were one.
    Wanted to fight this war without weapons.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And I wanted it, I wanted it bad.
    But there were so many red flags.
    Now another one bites the dust.
    Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    You did not break me.
    I'm still fighting for peace.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
    but your blade—it might be too sharp.
    I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
    yeah, I may snap and I move fast.
    But you won't see me fall apart,
    'cause I've got an elastic heart.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    I've got an elastic heart
    Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And I will stay up through the night.
    And let's be clear, won't close my eyes.
    And I know that I can survive.
    I'll walk through fire to save my life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And I want it, I want my life so bad.
    I'm doing everything I can.
    Then another one bites the dust.
    It's hard to lose a chosen one.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    You did not break me.
    I'm still fighting for peace.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
    but your blade—it might be too sharp.

    But you won't see me fall apart,
    'cause I've got an elastic heart.

  <p class="bridge">
    Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh.
