<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    I heard there was a secret chord,
    that David played and it pleased the Lord,
    but you don't really care for music, do you?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth,
    the minor fall and the major lift,
    the baffled king composing Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Your faith was strong but you needed proof,
    you saw her bathing on the roof,
    her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    She tied you to her kitchen chair,
    she broke your throne and she cut your hair,
    and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Baby I've been here before,
    i've seen this room, i've walked this floor,
    I used to live alone before I knew ya.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And I've seen your flag on the marble arch,
    and love is not a victory march,
    it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Well there was a time when you let me know,
    what's really going on below,
    but now you never show that to me do ya.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But remember when I moved in you,
    and the holy dove was moving too,
    and every breath we drew was Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe there's a God above,
    but all I've ever learned from love,
    was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And it's not a cry that you hear at night,
    it's not somebody who's seen the light,
    it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah.
  </p>
