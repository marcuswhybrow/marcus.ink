        <p>
          <span>I heard there was a secret chord</span>
          <span>that David played and it pleased the Lord</span>
          <span>but you don't really care for music, do you?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth</span>
          <span>the minor fall and the major lift</span>
          <span>the baffled king composing Hallelujah.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
            <span>Hallelujah</span>
            <span>Hallelujah</span>
            <span>Hallelujah</span>
            <span>Hallelujah.</span>
          </p>
        <p>
          <span>Your faith was strong but you needed proof</span>
          <span>you saw her bathing on the roof</span>
          <span>her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>She tied you to her kitchen chair</span>
          <span>she broke your throne and she cut your hair</span>
          <span>and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Baby I've been here before</span>
          <span>I've seen this room, I've walked this floor</span>
          <span>I used to live alone before I knew ya</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>And I've seen your flag on the marble arch</span>
          <span>And love is not a victory march</span>
          <span>It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Well there was a time when you let me know</span>
          <span>What's really going on below</span>
          <span>But now you never show that to me do ya</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>But remember when I moved in you</span>
          <span>And the holy dove was moving too</span>
          <span>And every breath we drew was Hallelujah</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Maybe there's a God above</span>
          <span>But all I've ever learned from love</span>
          <span>Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>And it's not a cry that you hear at night</span>
          <span>it's not somebody who's seen the light</span>
          <span>it's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah</span>
          <span>Hallelujah.</span>
