Your baby doesn't love you anymore.

Golden days before they end, whisper secrets to the wind.
Your baby won't be near you any more.

Tender nights before they fly, send falling stars that seem to cry.
Your baby doesn't want you anymore.

It's over.

It breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue.
But oh what will you do?

When she said to you "there's someone new, we're through."

We're through.

<p class="chorus">
  It's over!
  It's over!
  It's over!
</p>

All the rainbows in the sky, start to weep, then say goodbye.
You won't be seeing rainbows any more.

Setting suns before they fall, echo to you "that's all, that's all."
But you'll see lonely sunset after all.


  It's over.
  It's over.  

<p class="chorus">It's over! It's over!</p>
