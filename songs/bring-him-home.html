<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    God on high, hear my prayer.
    In my need you have always been there.
    He is young, he's afraid.
    Let him rest heaven blessed.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Bring him home,
    bring him home,
    bring him home.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>He's like the son I might have known,
    If God had granted me a son.
    The summers die one by one,
    how soon they fly on and on.
    And I am old and will be gone.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bring him peace, bring him joy.
    He is young, he is only a boy.
    You can take, you can give.
    Let him be, let him live.
    If I die, let me die,
    let him live.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Bring him home,
    bring him home,
    bring him home.
  </p>
