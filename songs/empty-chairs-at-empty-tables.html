<div id="lyrics">
  <p class="chorus">
    There's a grief that can't be spoken.
    There's a pain goes on and on.
    Empty chairs at empty tables.
    Now my friends are dead and gone.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here they talked of revolution.
    Here it was they lit the flame.
    Here they sang about tomorrow.
    And tomorrow never came.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    From the table in the corner.
    They could see a world reborn.
    And they rose with voices ringing.
    And I can hear them now.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>The very words that they had sung.
    Became their last communion.
    On this lonely barricade at dawn.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me.
    That I live and you are gone.
    There's a grief that can't be spoken.
    There's a pain goes on and on.
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Phantom faces at the windows.
    Phantom shadows on the floor.
    Empty chairs at empty tables.
    Where my friends will meet no more.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me.
    What your sacrifice was for.
    Empty chairs at empty tables.
    Where my friends will sing no more.
  </p>
