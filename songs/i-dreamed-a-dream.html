<div id="lyrics">
  <p>There was a time when men were kind, when their voices were soft, and their words inviting.</p>
  
  <p>There was a time when love was blind, and the world was a song, and the song was exciting.</p>
  
  <p>There was a time. Then it all went wrong.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    I dreamed a dream in time gone by.
    When hope was high and life worth living.
    I dreamed that love would never die.
    I dreamed that God would be forgiving.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Then I was young and unafraid.
    And dreams were made and used and wasted.
    There was no ransom to be paid.
    No song unsung, no wine untasted.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    But the tigers come at night.
    With their voices soft as thunder.
    As they tear your hope apart.
    As they turn your dream to shame.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    He slept a summer by my side.
    He filled my days with endless wonder.
    He took my childhood in his stride.
    But he was gone when autumn came.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    And still I dream he'll come to me.
    That we will live the years together.
    But there are dreams that cannot be.
    And there are storms we cannot weather.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    I had a dream my life would be.
    So different from this hell I'm living.
    So different now from what it seemed.
    Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.
  </p>
