There is a castle on a cloud.
I like to go there in my sleep.
Aren't any floors for me to sweep.
Not in my castle on a cloud.

There is a room that's full of toys.
There are a hundred boys and girls.
Nobody shouts or talks too loud.
Not in my castle on a cloud.

<p class="bridge">
  There is a lady all in white.
  Holds me and sings a lullaby.
  She's nice to see and she's soft to touch.
  She says, "Cosette, I love you very much".

I know a place where no one's lost.
I know a place where no one cries.
Crying at all is not allowed.
Not in my castle on a cloud.
