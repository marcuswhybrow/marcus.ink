Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time.
I feel alive, and the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah!
I'm floating around in ecstasy.

So don't stop me now, don't stop me,
'cause I'm having a good time, having a good time.

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger defying the laws of gravity.
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva, I'm gonna go, go, go there's no stopping me.

I'm burning through the sky, yeah! Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.
I'm traveling at the speed of light; I wanna make a supersonic man out of you.

<p class="chorus">
  Don't stop me now. I'm having such a good time. I'm having a ball.
  Don't stop me now. If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call.
  Don't stop me now, 'cause I'm having a good time.
  Don't stop me now, yes I'm having a good time.
  I don't want to stop at all, yeah!
</p>

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course. I am a satellite. I'm out of control.
I am a sex machine ready to reload, like an atom bomb about to oh-oh-oh-oh-oh explode.

I'm burning through the sky, yeah! Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.
I'm traveling at the speed of light, I wanna make a supersonic woman of you.

<p class="bridge">
  Don't stop me, don't stop me don't stop me. Hey hey hey!
  Don't stop me, don't stop me. Ooh ooh ooh. (I like it).
  Don't stop me, don't stop me. Have a good time, good time.
  Don't stop me, don't stop me. Ooh ooh alright.

Ooh I'm burning through the sky, yeah! Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.
I'm traveling at the speed of light, I wanna make a supersonic man out of you.

<p class="chorus">
  Don't stop me now. I'm having such a good time. I'm having a ball.
  Don't stop me now. If you wanna have a good time, (alright) just give me a call.
  Don't stop me now, 'cause I'm having a good time.
  Don't stop me now, yes, I'm having a good time.
  I don't wanna stop at all.
