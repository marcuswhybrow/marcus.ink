And now I'm all alone again, nowhere to turn, no one to go to,
without a home, without a friend, without a face to say hello to.
And now the night is near, now I can make believe he's here.

Sometimes I walk alone at night when ev'rybody else is sleeping.
I think of him and then I'm happy with the company I'm keeping.
The city goes to bed and I can live in side my head.

<p class="chorus">
  On my own, pretending he's beside me.
  All alone. I walk with him till morning.
  Without him, I feel his arms around me.
  And when I lose my way, I close my eyes and he has found me.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  In the rain the pavement shines like silver.
  All the lights are misty in the river.
  In the darkness the trees are full of starlight.
  And all I see is him and me forever and forever.
</p>

_And I know it's only in my mind, that I'm talking to myself and not to him.
And although I know that he is blind, still I say there's a way for us._

<p class="chorus">
  I love him, but when the night is over,
  he is gone, the river's just a river.
  Without him, the world around me changes.
  The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  I love him, but every day I'm learning.
  All my life, I've only been pretending.
  Without me, his world will go on turning.
  A world that's full of happiness, that I have never known.
</p>

_I love him. I love him. I love him. But only on my own._
