<div id="lyrics">
  <p>Your baby doesn't love you anymore.</p>
  
  <p>
    Golden days before they end, whisper secrets to the wind.
    Your baby won't be near you any more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tender nights before they fly, send falling stars that seem to cry.
    Your baby doesn't want you anymore.
  </p>
  
  <p>It's over.</p>
  
  <p>
    It breaks your heart in two, to know she's been untrue.
    But oh what will you do?
  </p>
  
  <p>When she said to you "there's someone new, we're through."</p>
  
  <p>We're through.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    It's over!
    It's over!
    It's over!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    All the rainbows in the sky, start to weep, then say goodbye.
    You won't be seeing rainbows any more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Setting suns before they fall, echo to you "that's all, that's all."
    But you'll see lonely sunset after all.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's over.
    It's over.  
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">It's over! It's over!</p>
