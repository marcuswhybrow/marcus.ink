<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    I want to break free. I want to break free.
    I want to break free from your lies you're so self satisfied I don't need you.
    I've got to break free. 
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">God knows, God knows I want to break free.</p>
  
  <p>
    I've fallen in love. I've fallen in love for the first time and this time I know it's for real.
    I've fallen in love, yeah.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">God knows, God knows I've fallen in love.</p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    It's strange but it's true. I can't get over the way you love me like you do.
    But I have to be sure, when I walk out that door:
    Oh how I want to be free, baby. Oh how I want to be free. Oh how I want to break free.
  </p>

  <p>
    But life still goes on. I can't get used to, living without, living without, living without you by my side.
    I don't want to live alone, hey.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    God knows, got to make it on my own.
    So baby can't you see: I've got to break free.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I've got to break free. I want to break free, yeah.
    I want, I want, I want, I want to break free.
