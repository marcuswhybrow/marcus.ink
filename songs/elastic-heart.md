And another one bites the dust.
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one.
Wanted to fight this war without weapons.

And I wanted it, I wanted it bad.
But there were so many red flags.
Now another one bites the dust.
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one.

<p class="bridge">
  You did not break me.
  I'm still fighting for peace.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
  but your blade—it might be too sharp.
  I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
  yeah, I may snap and I move fast.
  But you won't see me fall apart,
  'cause I've got an elastic heart.
</p>

<p class="bridge">
  I've got an elastic heart
  Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
</p>

And I will stay up through the night.
And let's be clear, won't close my eyes.
And I know that I can survive.
I'll walk through fire to save my life.

And I want it, I want my life so bad.
I'm doing everything I can.
Then another one bites the dust.
It's hard to lose a chosen one.

<p class="bridge">
  You did not break me.
  I'm still fighting for peace.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
  but your blade—it might be too sharp.
  I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
  yeah, I may snap and I move fast.
  But you won't see me fall apart,
  'cause I've got an elastic heart.
</p>

<p class="bridge">
  Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh.
</p>

<p class="bridge">
  Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
  but your blade—it might be too sharp.
  I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
  yeah, I may snap and I move fast.
  But you won't see me fall apart,
  'cause I've got an elastic heart.

I've got an elastic heart.
