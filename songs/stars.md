<p class="chorus">
  There, out in the darkness, a fugitive running, fallen from God, fallen from grace.
  God be my witness, I never shall yield, 'til we come face to face, 'til we come face to face.
</p>

He knows his way in the dark. Mine is the way of the Lord
Those who follow the path of the righteous shall have their reward.
And if they fall as Lucifer fell: The flames, the sword!

<p class="chorus">
  Stars. In your multitudes. Scarce to be counted. Filling the darkness with order and light.
  You are the sentinels. Silent and sure. Keeping watch in the night. Keeping watch in the night.
</p>

You know your place in the sky. You hold your course and your aim.
And each in your season returns and returns and is always the same.
And if you fall as Lucifer fell: you fall in flame!

_And so it must be, for so it is written, on the doorway to paradise:
that those who falter and those who fall must pay the price!_

<p class="chorus">
  Lord, let me find him, that I may see him safe behind bars.
  I will never rest, 'til then. This I swear. This I swear by the stars!
