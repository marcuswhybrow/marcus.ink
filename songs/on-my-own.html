  <p>
    And now I'm all alone again, nowhere to turn, no one to go to,
    without a home, without a friend, without a face to say hello to.
    And now the night is near, now I can make believe he's here.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes I walk alone at night when ev'rybody else is sleeping.
    I think of him and then I'm happy with the company I'm keeping.
    The city goes to bed and I can live in side my head.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    On my own, pretending he's beside me.
    All alone. I walk with him till morning.
    Without him, I feel his arms around me.
    And when I lose my way, I close my eyes and he has found me.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    In the rain the pavement shines like silver.
    All the lights are misty in the river.
    In the darkness the trees are full of starlight.
    And all I see is him and me forever and forever.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <em>And I know it's only in my mind, that I'm talking to myself and not to him.
    And although I know that he is blind, still I say there's a way for us.</em>
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    I love him, but when the night is over,
    he is gone, the river's just a river.
    Without him, the world around me changes.
    The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    I love him, but every day I'm learning.
    All my life, I've only been pretending.
    Without me, his world will go on turning.
    A world that's full of happiness, that I have never known.
  </p>
  
  <p><em>I love him. I love him. I love him. But only on my own.</em></p>
