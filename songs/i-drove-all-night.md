I had to escape, the city was sticky and cruel.
Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you.

I was dreaming while I drove the long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah.

Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide.
This fever for you was just burning me up inside.

<p class="chorus">
  I drove all night, to get to you.
  Is that all right?
  I drove all night, crept in your room.
  Woke you from your sleep to make love to you.
  Is that all right?
  I drove all night.
</p>

What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go I hear, the beating of our one heart.

I think about you when the night is cold and dark, uh-huh, yeah.

No one can move me the way that you do.
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you, oh.

<p class="chorus">
  I drove all night, to get to you.
  Is that all right?
  I drove all night, crept in your room.
  Woke you from your sleep to make love to you.
  Is that all right?
  I drove all night.
</p>

Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide.
This fever for you was just burning me up inside.

<p class="chorus">
  I drove all night, to get to you.
  Is that all right?
  I drove all night, crept in your room.
  Is that all right?
  I drove all night
