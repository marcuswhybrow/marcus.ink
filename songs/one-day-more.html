    One day more. Another day, another destiny.
    This never ending road to Calvary.
    These men who seem to know my crime, will surely come a second time.
    One day more.

    <b>Eponine (Marius & Cosette):</b>
    One more day all on my own. (will we ever meet again?)
    One more day with him not caring. (I was born to be with you.)
    What a life I might have known (And I swear I will be true!)
    But he never saw me there!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Enjolras (Marius):</b>
    One more day before the storm, (do I follow where she goes)
    at the barricades of freedom. (shall I join my brothers there?)
    When our ranks begin to form, (Do I stay or do I dare?)
    will you take your place with me?

    Watch them run amuck, catch'm as they fall.
    Never know your luck when there's a free for all.
    Here a little dip, there a little touch.
    Most of them are goners so they won't miss much!
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    One day to a new beginning. (raise the flag of freedom high!)
    Every man will be a king. (every man will be a king.)
    There's a new world for the winning. (There's a new world to be won.)
    Do you hear the people sing?
