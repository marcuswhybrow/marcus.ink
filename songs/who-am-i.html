<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    He thinks that man is me, he knew him at a glance.
    That stranger he has found, this man could be my chance.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Why should I save his hide? Why should I right this wrong?
    When I have come so far, and struggled for so long?
  </p>
  
  <p>If I speak, I am condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned.</p>
  
  <p>
    I am the master of hundreds of workers, they all look to me.
    Can I abandon them, how would they live, if I am not free?
  </p>
  
  <p>If I speak, I am condemned. If I stay silent, I am damned.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">Who am I?</p>
  
  <p>
    Can I condemn this man to slavery?
    Pretend I do not feel his agony?
    This innocent who wears my face.
    Who goes to judgement in my place.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">Who am I?</p>
  
  <p>
    Can I conceal myself for evermore?
    Pretend I'm not the man I was before?
    And must my name until I die,
    be no more than an alibi?
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">Must I lie?</p>
  
  <p>
    How can I ever face my fellow men?
    How can I ever face myself again?
    My soul belongs to God, I know,
    I made that bargain long ago.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    He gave me hope, when hope was gone.
    He gave me strength to journey on.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">Who am I?</p>
  
  <p>Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean.</p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    And so Javert, you see it's true,
    that man bears no more guilt than you.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">Who am I?</p>
