**Valjean:**
One day more. Another day, another destiny.
This never ending road to Calvary.
These men who seem to know my crime, will surely come a second time.
One day more.

**Marius:**
I did not live until today. How can I live when we are parted?

**Valjean:**
(One day more.)

**Marius & Cosette:**
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away. And yet with you, my world has started.

**Eponine (Marius & Cosette):**
One more day all on my own. (will we ever meet again?)
One more day with him not caring. (I was born to be with you.)
What a life I might have known (And I swear I will be true!)
But he never saw me there!

**Enjolras (Marius):**
One more day before the storm, (do I follow where she goes)
at the barricades of freedom. (shall I join my brothers there?)
When our ranks begin to form, (Do I stay or do I dare?)
will you take your place with me?

<p class="chorus">The time, is now, the day, is here!</p>

**Valjean:**
One day more!

**Javert:**
One more day till revolution, we will nip it in the bud.
We'll be ready for these schoolboys, they will wet themselves with blood!

**Valjean:**
One day more!

**Thenardiers:**
Watch them run amuck, catch'm as they fall.
Never know your luck when there's a free for all.
Here a little dip, there a little touch.
Most of them are goners so they won't miss much!

<p class="chorus">
  One day to a new beginning. (raise the flag of freedom high!)
  Every man will be a king. (every man will be a king.)
  There's a new world for the winning. (There's a new world to be won.)
  Do you hear the people sing?
</p>

**Marius:**
My place, is here, I fight, with you!

**Valjean:**
One day more!

**Marius & Cosette:**
I did not live until today.

**Eponine:**
One more day all on my own.

**Javert:**
I will know their little secrets.
I will know the...

**Valjean:**
One day more!

**Marius:**
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away.

**Thenardiers:**
Never know your luck when there's a free-for-all.

**Javert:**
We'll be ready for these...

**Valjean:**
Tomorrow we'll be far away.
Tomorrow is the judgement day.

<p class="chorus">
  Tomorrow we'll discover what our god in heaven has in store!
  One more dawn. One more day. One day more!
