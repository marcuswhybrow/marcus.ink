    Pretty woman, walking down the street.
    Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet.
    Pretty woman:
    I don't believe you, you're not the truth.
    No one could look as good as you.
  </p>
  
  <p>Mercy.</p>
  
  <p>
    Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
    Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see.
    Pretty woman:
    That you look lovely as can be.
    Are you lonely just like me?
  </p>
  
  <p>Wow.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Pretty woman, stop a while.
    Pretty woman, talk a while.
    Pretty woman, give your smile to me.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah.
    Pretty woman, look my way.
    Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right.
    Come with me baby, be mine tonight.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Pretty woman, don't walk on by.
    Pretty woman, don't make me cry.
    Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey.
    OK.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If that's the way it must be, OK.
    I guess I'll go on home, it's late.
    There'll be tomorrow night, but wait!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    What do I see?
    Is she walking back to me?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yeah, she's walking back to me!
    Oh, oh, pretty woman.
