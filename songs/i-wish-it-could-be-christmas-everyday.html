<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    When the snowman brings the snow, well he just might like to know,
    he's put a great big smile on somebody's face.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you jump into your bed, quickly cover up your head,
    don't you lock the doors, you know that sweet Santa Clause is on the way.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Oh well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
    When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
    Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
    Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    When we're skating in the park, if the storm cloud paints it dark,
    then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now the frosticles appear, and they've frozen up my beard.
    So we'll lie by the fire till the sleep simply melts them all away.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
    When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
    Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
    Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mark">Interlude</p>
  
  <p>
    When the snowman brings the snow, well he just might like to know,
    He's put a great big smile on somebody's face.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So if Santa brings that sleigh, all along the milky way,
    I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow, then he may decide to stay.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
    When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
    Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
    So let the bells ring out for Christmas.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
    When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
    I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
    Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
  </p>
  
  <p>Why don't you give your love for Christmas?</p>
