        Hark! the herald angels sing: "Glory to the newborn King!
        Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled."
      </p>
      <p>
        Joyful, all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies.
      </p>
      <p class="chorus">
        With angelic hosts proclaim: "Christ is born in Bethlehem"
        Hark! the herald angels sing: "Glory to the newborn King!"
      </p>

      <p>
        Christ by highest Heav'n adored, Christ the everlasting Lord!
        Late in time behold Him come, offspring of a Virgin's womb.
      </p>
      <p>
        Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; Hail the incarnate Deity.
      </p>
      <p class="chorus">
        Pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus, our Emmanuel.
        Hark! the herald angels sing: "Glory to the newborn King!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Hail the Heav'n-born Prince of Peace! Hail the Son of Righteousness!
        Light and life to all He brings, Ris'n with healing in His wings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mild He lays His glory by, Born that man no more may die.
      </p>
      <p class="chorus">
        Born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth.
        Hark! the herald angels sing: "Glory to the newborn King!"
