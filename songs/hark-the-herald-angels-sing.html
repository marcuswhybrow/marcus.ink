<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    Hark! the herald angels sing: "Glory to the newborn King!
    Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled."
  </p>
  
  <p>Joyful, all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    With angelic hosts proclaim: "Christ is born in Bethlehem"
    Hark! the herald angels sing: "Glory to the newborn King!"
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Christ by highest Heav'n adored, Christ the everlasting Lord!
    Late in time behold Him come, offspring of a Virgin's womb.
  </p>
  
  <p>Veiled in flesh the Godhead see; Hail the incarnate Deity.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus, our Emmanuel.
    Hark! the herald angels sing: "Glory to the newborn King!"
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Hail the Heav'n-born Prince of Peace! Hail the Son of Righteousness!
    Light and life to all He brings, Ris'n with healing in His wings.
  </p>
  
  <p>Mild He lays His glory by, Born that man no more may die.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Born to raise the sons of earth, born to give them second birth.
    Hark! the herald angels sing: "Glory to the newborn King!"
  </p>
