Feigning joy and surprise at the gifts we despise over mulled wine, with you.
On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month the sleigh bells are in time, ringing true.

How we cling each Noel to that snowflake's hope in hell that it won’t end!

<p class="chorus">
  Don’t let the bells end.
  Christmas time, just let them ring in peace.
</p>

Well the weather is cruel and the season of Yule warms the heart, but it still hurts.
You’ve got your career, spent the best part of last year apart, and it still hurts.

So that’s why I pray each and every Christmas day that it won’t end!

<p class="chorus">
  Don’t let the bells end.
  Christmas time, just let them ring in peace.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Christmas time, don’t let the bells end.
  Christmas time, don’t let the bells end.
</p>

<p class="bridge">
  Dust underneath the mistletoe leaves when you’re not here.
  You went away upon boxing day,
  now how the hell am I gonna make it into the New Year.
</p>

<p class="mark">
  Interlude
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Christmas time, don’t let the bells end.
  Christmas time, don’t let the bells end.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Christmas time, don’t let the bells end.
  Christmas time, just let them ring in peace.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Christmas time, don’t let the bells end.
  Christmas time, don’t let the bells end.
