Pretty woman, walking down the street.
Pretty woman, the kind I like to meet.
Pretty woman:
I don't believe you, you're not the truth.
No one could look as good as you.

Mercy.

Pretty woman, won't you pardon me?
Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see.
Pretty woman:
That you look lovely as can be.
Are you lonely just like me?

Wow.

<p class="chorus">
  Pretty woman, stop a while.
  Pretty woman, talk a while.
  Pretty woman, give your smile to me.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Pretty woman, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  Pretty woman, look my way.
  Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me.
</p>

<p class="bridge">
  'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right.
  Come with me baby, be mine tonight.
</p>

Pretty woman, don't walk on by.
Pretty woman, don't make me cry.
Pretty woman, don't walk away, hey.
OK.

If that's the way it must be, OK.
I guess I'll go on home, it's late.
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait!

What do I see?
Is she walking back to me?

Yeah, she's walking back to me!
Oh, oh, pretty woman.
