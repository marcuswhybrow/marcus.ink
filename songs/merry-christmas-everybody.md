Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
It's the time that every Santa has a ball.

Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer? Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

<p class="chorus">
  So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
  Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
</p>

Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?

Does your granny always tell ya, that the old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock and rollin' with the rest.

<p class="chorus">
  So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
  Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
</p>

<p class="bridge">
  What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissin' Santa Claus?
  Ah-ha-ha. Ah-ha-ha.
</p>

Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?

Do you ride on down the hillside, in a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head, then you been slayed.

<p class="chorus">
  So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
  Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
  Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun (it's Christmas). 
  Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
</p>
