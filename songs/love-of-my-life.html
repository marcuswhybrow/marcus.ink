<div id="lyrics">
  <p>Love of my life, you've hurt me. You've broken my heart and now you leave me.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Love of my life, can't you see? Bring it back, bring it back.
    Don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.
  </p>
  
  <p>Love of my life, don't leave me. You've taken my love. You now desert me.</p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Love of my life, can't you see? Bring it back, bring it back.
    Don't take it away from me because you don't know what it means to me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You will remember when this is blown over and everything's all by the way.
    When I grow older I will be there at your side to remind you how I still love you.
    I still love you.

  <p>Back, hurry back. Please, bring it back home to me because you don't know what it means to me.</p>
  
  <p>Love of my life. Love of my life.</p>
