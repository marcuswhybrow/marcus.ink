        Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
        It's the time that every Santa has a ball.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer? Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
        Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
      </p>

      <p class="chorus">
        So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
        Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
        Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
      </p>
      <p>
        Does your granny always tell ya, that the old songs are the best?
        Then she's up and rock and rollin' with the rest.
      </p>

      <p class="chorus">
        So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
        Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
      </p>

      <p class="bridge">
        What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissin' Santa Claus?
        Ah-ha-ha. Ah-ha-ha.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
        Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you ride on down the hillside, in a buggy you have made?
        When you land upon your head, then you been slayed.
      </p>

      <p class="chorus">
        So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
        Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
      </p>

      <p class="chorus">
        So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
        Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
      </p>

      <p class="chorus">
        So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun (it's Christmas). 
        Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
