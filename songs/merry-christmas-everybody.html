<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
    It's the time that every Santa has a ball.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer? Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
    Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
    Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
    Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Does your granny always tell ya, that the old songs are the best?
    Then she's up and rock and rollin' with the rest.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
    Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissin' Santa Claus?
    Ah-ha-ha. Ah-ha-ha.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?
    Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Do you ride on down the hillside, in a buggy you have made?
    When you land upon your head, then you been slayed.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
    Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun.
    Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    So here it is, Merry Christmas, everybody's having fun (it's Christmas). 
    Look to the future now, it's only just begun.
  </p>
