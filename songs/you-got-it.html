<div id="lyrics">
  <p>
    Every time I look into your lovely eyes,
    I see a love that money just can't buy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One look from you, I drift away.
    I pray that you are here to stay.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Anything you want, you got it.
    Anything you need, you got it.
    Anything at all, you got it.
    Baby!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every time I hold you I begin to understand,
    everything about you tells me I'm your man.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I live my life to be with you.
    No one can do the things you do.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Anything you want, you got it.
    Anything you need, you got it.
    Anything at all, you got it.
    Baby!
  </p>
  
  <p class="bridge">
    Anything you want (you got it),
    Anything you need (you got it),
    Anything at all!
  </p>
  
  <p class="mark">Interlude</p>
  
  <p>
    I'm glad to give my love to you.
    I know you feel the way I do.
  </p>
  
  <p class="chorus">
    Anything you want, you got it.
    Anything you need, you got it.
    Anything at all, you got it.
    Baby!

  <p class="chorus">
    Anything you want, you got it.
    Anything you need, you got it.
    Anything at all, you got it.
    Baby!

  <p>
    Anything at all (you got it).
    Baby, you got it!
