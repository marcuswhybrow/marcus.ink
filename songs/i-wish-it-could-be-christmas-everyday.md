When the snowman brings the snow, well he just might like to know,
he's put a great big smile on somebody's face.

If you jump into your bed, quickly cover up your head,
don't you lock the doors, you know that sweet Santa Clause is on the way.

<p class="chorus">
  Oh well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
  When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
  Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
  Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
</p>

When we're skating in the park, if the storm cloud paints it dark,
then your rosy cheeks gonna light my merry way.

Now the frosticles appear, and they've frozen up my beard.
So we'll lie by the fire till the sleep simply melts them all away.

<p class="chorus">
  Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
  When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
  Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
  Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
</p>

<p class="mark">Interlude</p>

When the snowman brings the snow, well he just might like to know,
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face.

So if Santa brings that sleigh, all along the milky way,
I'll sign my name on the rooftop in the snow, then he may decide to stay.

<p class="chorus">
  Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
  When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
  Oh I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
  So let the bells ring out for Christmas.
</p>

<p class="chorus">
  Well I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
  When the kids start singing and the band begins to play.
  I wish it could be Christmas everyday.
  Let the bells ring out for Christmas.
</p>

Why don't you give your love for Christmas?
