"... don't take the second step or the third, start with the first thing close in".

These words by David Whyte, [^1] since hearing them three days ago, have quite effected me.
Whyte himself described my predicament, indeed lauded it in a conversation with Sam Harris, [^2] as a prime quality of poetry:
words against which one has no defence;
words which evince realities already known to you.
And the stanza continues, importunately: "the step you don't want to take."
Two weeks I'd been working a tough nut, coding away, forging something, honing a second step.
Throwing it all overboard, now I started with a new idea, a simplification, I started with the first thing... close in.

I was building my own "continuous deployment" pipeline, a software production line which assembles raw materials into a working product in an automated, and therefore dependable, manner.
I got it working, and it did what I wanted it to do, but it did it in a way I wasn't conformable relying upon.
I'd built a wobbly pedestal for my priceless vase.
And that wouldn't answer at all.
I wasn't there yet, but I would get there eventually.
But _eventually_ there was a realisation: I had jumped ahead, made assumptions, and two interesting people were admonishing me for exactly that.
David Whyte I have already mentioned, but in that same epoch I was learning that [Agile is Dead][1] and the parallels between Whyte's poetry and the spirit of the [Agile Manifesto][2] are invigorating.
I hadn't stared with the first thing, and that had reduced my agility in choosing between futures.
I had become committed to something I didn't understand, to a design which didn't authentically arise from my own requirements;
to a dream which wasn't mine. "Someone else's heroics".

I started from scratch, and close in.
"Start right now, take a small step you can call your own, don’t follow someone else’s heroics".
Within one day I found myself a rock steady plinth for my pricey porcelain.
The vase was safe, and on display.
In fact I was inspired to start close in with a few other things;
this short article being one—the indirect fruit of David's poem.
It was David's words which infiltrated my perceptions, David's words which, in my mind at least, lassoed stars from the constellation of existentialist psychological thinking, suns from the nebulous expanse of mythology.

Start close in,  
don't take the second step  
or the third,  
start with the first  
thing  
close in,  
the step  
you don't want to take.
