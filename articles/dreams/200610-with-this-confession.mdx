A fine restaurant, adult professional waitresses in formal uniform, clean tables, a warm atmosphere.
It's also a kind of cafeteria or carvery in which I must go up to the counters and participate in selecting my meal.
So that's the such and such and the thing-e-me-bob she said but referencing the official names of the things I'd chosen.
I couldn't really take it in because those names meant little to me and are hard to remember.
I was handed a plate of nachos and walked back to my table.

I sat down with Jordan Peterson as with a family member.
A waitress arrives pensive, obviously bearing undesired news.
She asks me questions that make me feel as if I don't really fit into her world of knowledge.
She asked me if I ordered the so and so, and was expecting this or that.
I felt like I was being asked to say how things should work, but that that was their responsibility and here I was incompetent, and embarrassed.
Everything is resolved that I am going to receive a serving of chicken to go along side my nachos.
And come to think of it that would be a more appropriate arrangement than simply a plate of crisps.

So you like guns? Jordan muses with smiling surprise.
I say that, yer, I guess that I do don't I?
The Waitress were now satisfied and had gone away, and so with this confession I spring up from my seat, from my nachos and zip around the table in a circle.
Peterson is laughing and I'm hyped up, as if the confession of what I liked unleashed this freedom and energy.
I become my most playful self, childlike in my insouciance in my wonder.

I see a sweet looking girl in formal dress, a lawyer maybe, a professional looking young woman.
I see her in her element, in the flow of her life, busy, stressed, overwhelmed.
I see that she is somehow absolved of sexuality, and unattractive that way.
Now I'm face to face with a waitress from earlier and her attire is overtly sexual: revealing, provocative.
She wears it with total indifference as if she is an object unto herself, an unfeeling machine.

My attention widens to a room filling with more and more women in this same energy and costume.
I feel a deep conflict, I expect a single rancid ugly bond villain.
I expect a poisoned core, an enforcing kingpin to emerge.

No, they have captured the nice girl and strung her up like a prize fish.
The feeling is transmitted: what are you doing looking at this, looking at her?
She is not beautiful, she is not like us, she is not what you should want!
The girls are horrific, possessed, enraged, demonic.
They had pulled from their captive the clothes which made her different.
They forced her nakedness, they insisted on her sexual aspect, examined it, compared it, as if to say "there! You she she was hiding it all along. Her allure, her potency is weaker than ours, we win".
Ropes pulling her legs apart into the splits, hands restrained behind her back, a forced arching of the back evincing her breasts.
They gripped her like an animal, displayed her like an animal.

I felt her to be more worthy of admiration for all the waitresses had hoped to achieve the opposite.
She was not possessed by anger but fought and struggled against her situation.
She was, yes, a claimant to sexuality as much as them, but where they had hoped to diminish her in the comparison, they had only bolstered her.
I saw that she was no less than these others, that she was maybe even more beautiful than those who depended on beauty much more.
