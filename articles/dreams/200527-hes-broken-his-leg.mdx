Me, Chris, and a my Chinese friend—who speaks a sparse, timid English—alone in our apartment; waking up of a morning.
Chris' room has a shower which he cannot use whilst the bed is established for the room is long and narrow and the shower ends up behind the bed-head.
Our friend asks why nobody uses the showers in his room, of which there are two.
I use this one I object, pointing to the booth closest to the entrance.
But then there was a second shower in the same room; a curious arrangement.

In the living room, the central space of the apartment, we chatted about games.
Did you remember \____ asks our friend.
And I didn't remember, I didn't even recognise the strange name, a name which I wouldn't even have attributed to a game.
I don't think that was released in the UK I offer.
Why did I say "UK" and not "here" I find myself noticing?

We cannot make arrangements because Chris is bespoke by "David" for a game of football which will begin shortly.
I do not know a David but promptly a new cohort descend on the apartment: tall, athletic, otherworldly, lively; Jamaicans retiring from a galvanising off-stage episode.
The tallest and strongest of the new arrivals had a dexterous foot which excelled at grasping the spirited hacky sack which animated their entrance.
I wanted to speak out and say how good he was at his skill, perhaps he was the David of which Chris spoke.

But Chris was at once joining in—limbering up with a jaunty dance.
He looked so different to his friends, and I couldn't find the comparison flattering.
A naive exuberance?
He clips his knee on our breakfast room table leg, a collapsible table leg, imparting it's nature now for Chris collapsed to the ground in a protective crouch.
I saw him eventually try to move and immediately regretting it.
"He's broken his leg" someone joked and I felt I alone knew the buried truth in the quip.
