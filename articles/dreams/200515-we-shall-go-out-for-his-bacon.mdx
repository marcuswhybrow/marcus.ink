A thrumming mute: my hand plays a neat staccato, the fluttering modulation of my own voice.
Not from the mouth: from the forehead, and my hand dances there.
Chris and Dom really start to laugh, "that's really funny."
I know to make a person laugh is everything, and I have made my heroes laugh.

Mr Wolstenholme looks to breakfast, I offer our wares in my mothers style.
He will have bacon, that's what he fanciesâ€”and we have no bacon.
We shall go out for his bacon, and yet is it not he who will go, and is it not me who is keeping him.
