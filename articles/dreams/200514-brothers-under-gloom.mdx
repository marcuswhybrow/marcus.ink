To reach the crossroads was to look upon rugged fields, and men everywhere, soldier's in the twilight.
A whispering wind yielding to raucous engines falling from heaven.
Four black wings ripping the air apart in approach.
After a bitter raking they recede to the dark and are gone.

Walking the captain's map, through forests, and little in certainty.
The arrogant crag on sweeping heath abates and establishes.
A wicked light up there flickering against us.
Digging in and embracing as brothers under gloom.

Mum types out a snarling address, the fractal complications, a friend's email.
Amazed and annoyed, do I speak out.
I do not.
