Dad is driving the car down ever more narrow streets.
In fact, so close are the beautiful medieval buildings on all sides we appear to have ended up inside one.
He drifts to the left coming close to scraping the paintwork on the ancient stone.
Some local inhabitant, perhaps the owner of these exquisite apartments, is disturbed by our presence.
And now we can progress no further—must turn about and go back.

I get out to investigate a courtyard I saw on the way, something like a beer garden.
It has a ramp leading down onto it's lawn, and a ramp leading up and out at the far end: a ramp leading up and out into open country, freedom.
But now my family have caught up to me I see the exit ramp is not a ramp but a series of steep steps no car could ascend.
And at this an old banger belonging to one of the drinkers starts up and accelerates horrifically up the inlet ramp—the one which would have lead us down into the garden—and disappears.
Everyone feels this an inappropriate boast of aggression and mighty dangerous—he could have killed someone!

The crowd gathers around Donald Trump, and I stand using crutches wearing a cowboy hat knowing I present a façade.
Everyone listens and I'm wondering what the make-up of the audience is, do they hate me if I listen to this man?
Everyone seems to be listening and I listen also.
He conjures a comical pretence: we look like a firing squad, says he, standing up here gathered on the veranda, and he bids us fire down upon one man on the lawn, who slowly realises he has been singled out. Our target is in high spirits and relishes the attention, embraces his theatrical role.

I'm leaning my back against a wooden pillar.
Trump crosses in front of me on his magisterial path my feet getting in his way.
I apologise for that and he reciprocates downplaying the significance.
When he passes by and moves on his way, I leave behind my crutches and walk off, presumably redounding negatively upon my congruence.

Now I'm free out on the sweeping turf, the rolling hills.
From across the water I'm being judged (judged by a woman?) because I'm sitting in a cart with prostitutes.
I have to wait until there are no more prostitutes before I may carry on my journey.
At first there are many, then a few, then none.
And now I can return to my family carrying baskets of water returning by way of our garden.
Rejoining as they also carry baskets alongside me.

Somehow the quality of the garden, the place, is all different, hyper social, as if it's the setting for a populous event, not the quiet private place of a few unknown lives. The setting sun, the golden half light, the warm wind, a deep assurance, everything is right.
