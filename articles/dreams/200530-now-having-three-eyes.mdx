"I will just do it like this", balancing on my left leg crouched down, leaning forwards, right leg trailing behind me like a counterbalancing tail; arms like a runner, pose like a runner—I'm a simulacrum of a runner, a frozen mime.
Dad perhaps would have shown me a way.
We were on the patio.
I saw my own face adopt glasses—my brothers glasses?
I set them normally and judged.
I set the left lens over my right eye and judged—now having three eyes.
