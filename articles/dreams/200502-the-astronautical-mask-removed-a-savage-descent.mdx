A dusky room for a shining personality, a quiet which draws my attention, the slight electric shiver—just like when the optician inspects my eye, close in.
There he is, spacesuit on, smiling at the same situation.
Adam Savage, the man himself, is waiting to to have his photograph taken.
He stands in the light, the only light in the room, of a projected image.
Behind him a planetary backdrop projected, which seems out of focus to me, completes the picture;
and then presumably the picture is taken:
we are chatting afterwards, in the full bright of a lit room, Adam, the photographer and me.

The focus has moved on, pictures are no longer being taken, but that doesn't seem to matter to me.
Now I stand center stage, besuited astronautically, and struggle with the mask.
A gas mask almost, a clinging thing of tightening rubber straps.
I pull them tight, taught—maybe too taught, too tight; actually, yes way too tight, choking my neck.
But no sooner had this face-hugging rubberised headcrab of a mask got the better of me I had got the better of it.
I took it off, holding it, only slightly uneasily, like a severed head by my side.

The photographer had been away for some time.
I took a seat next to Adam on the bench which encircled this small hall.
He was exhausted. Exhausted yes, but still ethereally joyful, still wondrous.
Words drifted between us, laughter, analgesic sounds, relaxing talk.
I put by arm about his shoulder and was actually becoming concerned.
Adam wasn't all together together, something deeper than lethargy was afoot, I could sense it.

Come on, let's get you up. Maybe I said something like that, but Adam really wasn't responding.
He was as if concussed, as if within an acute dementia.
He was fading.
Where was that damn photographer!
When he stood up he dawdled about listlessly.
I took a deeper level of care, and, supporting him with my right arm, led him out of the hallway.
We had to find help.

We wanted people, we found a tunnel.
We found cold itself crawling freely from it's lowly abode.
We found a tunnel going down, a shaft really, actually a drop which necessitated a staircase but which had forgotten such responsibilities.
What I could see, in the old gloom, what I now noticed, where stacks of small boxes and objects.
Old plugs and containers, tools and materials, jars.
Oh! Looking down I saw it.
Footholds here and there, steps in the sheer perilous equipment stacks.
The appurtenances of production would facilitate a safe descent!

Immediately I'd overcommitted.
Everything was all wobbly.
When I took up a flat spot everything shook like a Jenga tower begging to be free.
Each step was so far beneath the other that I would never make it back up.
When it collapsed (because obviously this thing is going to collapse) it would take a lifetime to reassemble.

An improbable tower of small pointy devices fell on me.
A thousands years resting against a wall and I couldn't save it, it was already too late.
Enough of this!
I expedited, I concentrated, I abandoned my concerns.
I headed for the ground beneath, and found it.

Adam hopped down deftly.
Oh yeah!
Easily, effortlessly.
And he was making no more sense than before.
Except now he was dreaming out loud, as if the space itself was conversant, and everything he said was pertinent.

We used to come down here all the time when were young, he said.
We had to keep moving onwards, and onwards meant a low vaulted, straight, wide, tunnel; I lead him as he spoke.
The problem was you could loose yourself down here, said Adam, and seeing me cognisant of the detritus underfoot, when on: you just have to stand on everything confidently with your feet.
That's a lot easier if you're wearing shoes, I muttered, for I wasn't wearing shoes;
my bare feet felt every disgusting ridge of rubbish.

But that was me Adam was responding to!
He had noticed my predicament and was trying to help.
He was back with us! Or at least recovering his awareness.
I carried on, now cloaked in hope, and reflected on my own memories.
I searched for my own cold, vaulted, underfoot refuse tunnel.
Did I have such a memory, did I do the same.
I felt inadequate.
But that's okay.
Sometimes it is adequate to feel inadequate.
