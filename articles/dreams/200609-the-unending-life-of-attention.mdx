Elon Musk is walking out of the garden.
My garden.
As he turns, on his back, on his belt is something to reach out and grab, an act that would save him.
Something is attached to him which only I, in this moment, am aware of.

Now I'm on the other side of the 180 degree line.
I'm at the far end of my garden looking back.
I see Elon's face.
I see my house.
I see my neighbour's house, and I am overwhelmed by shame, irresponsibility, miss-use.
I possess an immense power, to which everyone is, in this moment, looking to me to use.
I realise that in looking into my neighbours property I am channelling that power like a laser.
I'm channelling my attention, my energy, onto them and that I must never do that, ever.
I feel it so acutely and I flick my attention back to my own garden, and to Elon.
But surely the damage is done.

With peace re-established Elon is reclining in a garden chair in the sun.
The image of a great rope stretches across my awareness.
I see that it thickens with it's progression, as it lives and proceeds from left to right.
A continuous strengthening into infinity.
I see in an instant that the nature of things is to improve:
that I don't need to improve the rope, I just need to follow it along.

And what of ends? This present section stretched before me is wonderful in it's own properties.
I do not need the end of a rope to tie a good not, to bind things together, to create great things.
No, I might never find an end, I don't need the end, I've never seen an end; but I can loop and apply the cord as it is, and that is all there is too it, and all there needs to be, and all there ever will be.
