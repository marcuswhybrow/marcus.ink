Laid out on the parchment are intricate, beautiful illustrations of various species.
An entomological or ornithological masterpiece perhaps?
But these are not small creatures, nor are they winged; they are human.
A voice attends to a particular illustration in middling terms.
There are many types of people, body types, different male body types: that was it!
This was a comparison of the different types of men.

The narrator was gathering to a final conclusion, and, addressing the final imageâ€”the tall slim build (my own form), named it, in a monotonous, rehearsed way, the most attractive form.
Words now about measurements of the jaw and shoulders, units I'd never heard of and couldn't decode.
I was hopeful that I might measure up.

But now I looked at the image on the parchment and frowned a little.
Have you ever seen a portrait from a bygone age, and, peering at it, think to yourself "I know I'm supposed to feel he looks important, but to me, now, today, he looks silly, unheroic; perhaps even a bit weird and ugly."
This is what I felt.
I didn't like the guy, despite his upright posture and fine clothes.
