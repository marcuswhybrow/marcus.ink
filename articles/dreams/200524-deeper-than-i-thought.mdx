"Where do you place your tee?"
I am forcing the game by the question.
The tee goes into the long grass; roots in the soil.
The white golf ball balances.

"What iron do you have?"
I take my fathers club.
Was it like this I should grip or this other way?
Swing, and scuffed it; an almost perpendicular trajectory into the forest.

A difficult hole: straight and narrow fairway,  
and not only forest on the right but water on the left.
Dad agrees, Chris is there.
I re-tee and hit it a great distance down-range; but into the water.

Reachable, not too far out, I could see my ball as I stood at the lip of the lake.
Facing the land I knelt and lowered in a bare foot.
I didn't find the bottom and lost my balance and my trousers, not being rolled up enough, would get wet.
I paused in the teetering situation and made small adjustments and did not slip in.

So it was deeper than I thought.
This time I faced the water and, sitting on the land dangled both legs in.
I would rescue the ball in the clasp of my two feet.
I made good use of my waterproof headlamp submerging it in the grasp of my right foot and seeing more clearly.
