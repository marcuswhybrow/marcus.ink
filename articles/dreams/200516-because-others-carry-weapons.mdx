::: div prose
I strafe and kill with vitality ailing,  
I impart death and evade my own, pulling the trigger.  
I creep in houses and stalk outskirts.  
I shall counter-snipe from the ascending forest slopes.

The pens of others, like my own, lay home-alone.  
Father returns, wise to my presence by fallacious ingenuity.  
Who then was it opened the desk draw and alerted him here?  
Militiamen are here, tourists on the ascending slopes.

All actions overt by force, I cannot take up the slopes.  
Here they gather, so I explain it to Father:  
"They carry weapons because others carry weapons!"
