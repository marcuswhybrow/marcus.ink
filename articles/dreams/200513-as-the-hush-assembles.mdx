Now he looms near my friends and me, now he announces a name to the theatre: "Marcus"—my name...

This had been the flow of the evening, he going around, anointing members of the cast for a moment in the spotlight.
A moment to speak about themselves, and for the audience to know them.
Each chosen actor or crew member, for we were all part of a grand project, a performance, was chosen for their exceptional effort.
Each person was thus honoured with thanks and applause and given a moment to express themselves.

But we all know how these things go, and it was in fact a very human admixture of tradition, boredom, misjudgement, enthusiasm, rivalry, politics...
The host was a man from my own life.
A man who, bearing nobody ill will, nevertheless spawned much ill feeling.
This fellow led the proceedings now and now my name was called.

Despite myself, I found I took it as my due, that my name would be mentioned.
I was also afraid and slightly cowed.
How was I going to be genuine in this moment?
How would I discontinue what did not want to become and be what I wanted to be?
A fluttering heart, yet a definite ambition, a scurry for virtue remembered.

A cheer went up with a hearty lethargy, a soothing friendly sound from a few in the audience.
No other had received such approbation, tacit warmth.
It's sometimes very difficult to see an audience, they are cast in shadow like Bond villains.
I stood up to take my place centre stage, to live out this honorific.
"I guess I'll put on my shirt" I chuckled to those who could hear—I'd been waiting in the wings in pyjamas, bare chested; a cause now though for a sartorial formality I hadn't needed in the slanting shadows.

Fumbling with the hem, a stage can make a thing feel so indulgent and deliberate, I chatted with a chap in the front row—I figuring he had known me, that he was a friend, that probably he had growled out earlier in encouragement because he caught my eye now with an easy countenance.
Whenever I've lost my moorings in the whirlpool of experience I'm thankful for the solid ground of honest conversation.
When the wind of scrutiny comes on to blow you out to sea, one can batten down the hatches, beginning again from what you know, something simple.
To chat with a friend is an easy thing and a beautiful thing, especially on stage; a calming thing.

Shirt on, my host gathers me onto a beautiful red leather couch.
I sit and he sits.
I hoist up my feet and sit cross-legged.
He is a big man.
He takes up two thirds of the seat and I resent it, I despair of this visual snubbing.
He wields a microphone absent mindedly as the hush assembles.
