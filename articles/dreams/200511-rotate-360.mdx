Our mission begins here, letting ourselves, every so quietly out of one darkness and into another; escaping the open corridor for a room with a close presence—a hotel room harbouring a pregnant silence.
Those are people under the covers weren't they? no.
No wait!
Evincing a crepuscular light—slightly uncovering my hand hitherto clasping my headlamp—I confirmed it.
People sleeping softly.
Several of them, many of them.
I don't understand.
This isn't right.
And where are my compatriots with whom I slooped in?

The worm had turned, expectation was falling apart, the inanimate emanated a profound alacrity—a knowing anticipation of undoing.
Back-tracking into the corridor I began an evasive pathway of confusion.
This must have been the wrong room, a mistake in place or time.
A stairwell of iron railings, a fire-escape I begin to ascend.
Reaching the top I recoil in confusion—no rooms here at all.
Where was I?
Where was this room!
And now in the dead of night I was spotted in this prowling mode.

A man addressed me on the descent.
An overtly quizzical fellow with a vociferous sarcasm.
He mentioned—or didn't mention, which was as good as mentioning it—that there were no rooms beyond the current flaw; no reason to be going up there.
He had me figured.
I had to get out of this place.

Briskly and with purpose I crossed an airfield of vehicles and machines.
With the twilight some fastidious enthusiasts were in and about the trucks and bikes.
"Rotate 360" mentioned a formula one driver to his friend.
He then engaged the engine of his go-kart moving forward exactly one 360 degree rotation of a wheel.
Moving past them I found promenading pedestrians, morning joggers moving towards the coming sun, and I began my own pace likewise.

Of all things I was gratified to see a friend from school, more a friend of a friend.
A boy who experienced scholastic fame in performing an act of vivacious courage before our assembled masses.
I jogged with him now, amongst all such early risers, as the sun rose.
