Eddie Hall noticed the bin of marbles, zip-lock bags like bags of flower.
Infatuated by the twisting amber details he tosses one sack onto his shoulder.
We're in the airport duty-free.
A man, young, (a Treason's Harbour "Turk"?), unable to speak our language nor we his, is drawn up by our behaviour.
What are we fussing over he must surely be wondering, and I communicate Eddie's passion for marbles, particularly amber marbles, by draping this latest procurement against the collection ensconced in his unzipped rucksack.
He gets the picture.
Eddie makes a gift to the Turk, a pack of his own.
I must buy my own pack, but that's because I am a closer friend who's rewards are other and greater.

But now, in the line for the till, I reach the cashier.
Where's my wallet?
I pop down the marbles on the counter.
I'll be right back I say and step away to think, poised like a gunslinger.
Where _is_ my wallet?
And, dreamlike, more comes, like distant whisps, mist on the horizon, memories: didn't I used to have a bag?
I don't have one now.
Did I have a bag?

Eddie has his arm around me, around my shoulder and I around his, and we walk as two men into great hoards emptying into city streets.
A merriment I do not understand.
I fear those men, but Eddie does not.
We turn off the street and deeper into the heart of jubilation.
Cheering, chanting, raucous celebration and I hold my free arm aloft in ascension; anything less felt a statement of opposition.
I was passing the team themselves, the uniformed sportsmen in green.
Or were they sports-boys?
I commended them with a clasp of the hand, a slap on shoulder, and felt I knew not what I was about.

We were passing back, inwards to a familiar place.
I knew it's familiarity only by discrepancies: a staircase which didn't exist last time.
Last time?
Was there a last time then?
Oh, I turned to Eddie, I might have left my bag under my seat in the stadium!
My wallet and my bag!
We passed up the discrepant stairs, and then immediately descended.
I scrutinised the feature as it passed.
Eddie now turned to me, you'll have to go to the \_\_\_\_, he said.
I said that I didn't know what that was and he described a kind of office, a place where lost things would accumulate.
There they would check my \_\_\_\_.
Again I asked what he was on about: money he said.
They will verify it's your bag by the money you used to buy your seat in the stadium.
I didn't quite understand but things sounded promising.
