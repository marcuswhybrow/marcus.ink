And leaning on the kitchen work surface I saw, through my gazing insouciance, a great crowd gathering on the patio.
A refulgent mix of rough, dangerous, looking characters where gathering and resting everywhere.
A dull feeling of territory lost: my own patio, besieged by a new patois.
So it was a great risk to be taking striding out to meet them as I now was, hands in my pockets, looking tough, looking ripe and mean—gruff.

I went unchallenged, which was a victory in itself.
I was blending in like a spy, an undercover cop who's blurred the lines, a man lost in his role.
I swaggered towards a semi-recumbent boy, a man really and, reaching him close up, impugned him with a force of words.
He protested: some aspects were necessary, some of the things he would do would be necessary.
"No unnecessary shit" I said walking away and winning my victory.

In another fragment I find myself locked in combat, struggling for supremacy with a naked form, and finding supremacy when a large belt contrived to restrain him—for I now saw it was a him (at least in part)—the belt denaturing those flailing arms and coiled, kicking legs. I raised this writhing body above me, hoisting it upwards—a flag aloft on the flag pole of my own legs, for I had been knocked to my back. Like an embittered chimp I assaulted, denigrated his manhood, not gouging, but hitting the testicles once; then again, and, seeing no repercussions, continuing at my base leisure.

There was nothing lascivious here.
Carnivorous.
I felt rage, I felt, supremacy... abandon.
But, yes, the penis was, of course, erect, and was, or shall I say _is_ being snatched by my own hand, and this very moment, this inevitable culmination, snatches me simultaneously from the illusion of the dream and the illusion of my first clause.
