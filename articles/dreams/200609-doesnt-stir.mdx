Trying to find the library in my old senior school.
I want to use the computers there.
Getting up and leaving a classroom the teacher doesn't stir.
I forget something and have to return, clanking the door.
Again the teacher ignores me.
I'm leaving.

I can't get my bearings, everything has changed: more complex, more corporate; larger, vast.
Bitter complaints to R██ M████: "I hate this!"
I never find the library.

Three train locomotives, high-speed, high-tech, bullet shaped—they could even be private jets—parked parallel.
In the dark, in the distance, beyond the fence, a man is walking away, breaking contact with me, leaving me behind; alone.
I pull the nose of the middle vehicle and lead it round like a horse, crudely repositioning the craft.
I feel this to be like a flare in the dark, a demonstration, an undeniable signal to the stranger.

Pondering my results—did I reach him?—I see a man sitting motionless on a chair guarding the way back, the way out.
I can get close up to him and he doesn't stir.
I know that he is supposed to come alive and destroy me but was never activated.
Eerie.

Jackie Chan, so the story goes, walked right in there and said: "I'm Jackie Chan, give me the role!"
