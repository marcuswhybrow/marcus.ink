He'd never ridden an electric motorbike.
We shouldn't work the engine on the incline.
We push the metal steed with our legs on the incline.
On the flat I turn the ignition key—plunge the stirrup.

Now a steep ascension, now rocks and scree, now mountain.
Now travellers walking their bikes up it by the nose.
And as the cap an amphitheatre of seats.
We arrive at—can the term be avoided—_the gods_ and Ashley and I take our seats.

A girl settles down with us, I hope I mean something to her.
She doesn't, or didn't, know me, but now asked me my name, which she jots down on her clipboard.
