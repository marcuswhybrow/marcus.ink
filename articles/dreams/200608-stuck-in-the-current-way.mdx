Military operations, possessing my own weapon, darkness and difficulty.
C████ W██████ flies up to the roof shooting at warheads amassed in the ceiling pointing at us, point down from silos, like stalactites.
He repeats the same behaviour and it never works, the threat is never overcome.
I can see exactly what he needs to do and that annoys me horrifically.
That's the problem with C████ he never sees what I see, he never changes, always stuck in the current way which doesn't work!
I'm so frustrated with him for that!
