He sat me down for a private word.
I respected him, looked up to him.
It was somehow myself I resented—the regurgitated excuses forthcoming.
He asked me about my work as we took a seat in the bathroom; I sat on the closed toilet.

And how long had I been under my father's tents, this was his topic now.
Was it a temporary thing, had it been years?
It had been years, and he asked be what the trouble was by a phrase I but understood and cannot explain.
I talked of myself, my creativity, my essential unique values and we both grew weaker in the hearing.
I knew condemnation from my own heart.




The assault trooper could fly only half the distance, and this was measured out with the red plastic rod in inches.
He could _just_ make it into fighting range with a model painted black, but that guy had two power axes to my measly chainsword.
The match up didn't feel good.
Behind Mr Power-Axe were several terminators and that really tipped the balance against me.
And behind the terminators the rest of Christopher's army amassed.

Supporting my singular assault trooper was a tank and a transport vehicle.
The situation was dire; my main force was backed into a literal corner on the board.
The tanks must pull back and fire, shoot-and-scoot—the only option—ultimately leading to no options when I fell all the way back to the corner.
