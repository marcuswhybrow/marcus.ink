A bird of prey!
There it was alighting on their side of the fence, in my neighbours garden.
Luminescent blue feathers, flashing green plumes, all now in a dead still, watching.
I could see the hedge (a memory which predates the concrete post and wood panel division of today) and looked for the object of his looking.
A Rabbit, now jumping and scuttering, pressed himself through the tangled branches, freezing again in the thicket boundary.

Now a simultaneity of explosive movement on both parts.
The bird was huge, monstrous.
Rabbit left the hedge, springing free towards our side, our lawn.
The bird fell into the branches like so much barbed wire, talons protruding, thrust out, extended on a reptilian stork, a long disgusting leg which overwhelms Rabbit, carapacing claws subduing his great evasion and dreadfully winching him now backwards into the branches, like so much barbed wire.
Does white furred Rabbit see me?
Yes, in that moment he does and he sees a man watching.
Watching from his parent's bedroom.
Watching a bundle of pure white revoked and receding.
Watching from above.

The bird—was he always such a gargoyle? a small elephant was smaller—opened a slobbering beak, a gnarled tucan-esque affair.
Rabbit is now proffered by the claw to the jaws, hovering as they slacken open.
The bird, quite slowly, pushes his lower mandible smoothly, inexorably into the nape of the neck as Rabbit sees only the ground, only green grass, and then goes limp.
The disgusting leg releases him into the jurisprudence of the mouth, into which Rabbit is ingratiated.
There he lies trapped and dead, not even swallowed.
The bird's attentions widen.
I do not want to be caught in them.

My parents bedroom is transformed, usually there's a bed, there's wardrobes, today it is empty, transformed.
Two boy's I respected in senior school and sixth-form were there.
They were popular and tough-minded, often friendly sometimes cantankerous, a popularity class above me, a chimeric entity each; the allure of a swashbuckling rogue.
The black barbell weights were piled high into a stubby plinth which one of my friends now jumped on.
He balanced admirably despite a lurching shift in the amalgam.
Afterwards he fished out a strap of velcro and we all looked at it.
My brother and I, in reality, had used just such a method to invent a sort of saddle bag weight for a physio regime designed to heal his knee; and it was this usage of velcro, to hold together, which we all bore down our attentions on now.
It wasn't a perfect solution we felt, but it was a good, surprisingly good, innovation.
My friends approved.

A stroppy invention of my imagination entered: an overweight, opinionated, demanding individual.
She tried to tell me what to do, but when I didn't concede that much she tried other ways to undermine the atmosphere.
And then she just as quickly left.
