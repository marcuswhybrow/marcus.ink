Feared intimacy, bodily close, not remembering what bones knew.
Fingers between toes. My hand, her foot.

Stranger to muscular guys in black tees, this is my place, I reply to the one who later drapes over me his intoxicated embrace, It's you all who turned up around me.

Lost exiting hospital corridors; dead ends, stumbling unwelcome.
Of a respected friend: catch his at the help desk before travelling on.
To a complaining friend: we do not complain of your complaining, we return to the good.
A terminus of slides leading down and out.
Then a door, finally a door, an outside (dark, smoky) bar.
But I turn away; to advertising screens I lament.
